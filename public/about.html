<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm Dharan, a first-year Computer Science student with a passion for technology and coding. I’m on an exciting journey to learn and grow every day, constantly improving my skills and diving deeper into the world of software development..</p>

<p>Currently, I’m starting my adventure in Web Development, and I’m really excited about the possibilities it offers. I’ve always been fascinated by the way technology shapes the world, and web development feels like the perfect path to explore that.

  Along the way, I’ve worked on 2D simple games and a variety of Python projects that helped me develop a solid foundation in programming and problem-solving. I enjoy building things from scratch, whether it’s a game or a simple utility, and learning new technologies along the way..</p>

<p>I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn, so feel free to connect with me if you’re interested in collaborating or sharing knowledge. I believe in continuous improvement, and I can’t wait to see where this journey takes me!
